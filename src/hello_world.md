Welcome to Software Wanderings, my new technical blog. I hope this
blog will encourage me to write about my experiences, learnings and
observations about software engineering. I am also making this blog
public and hopefully other people will find some of this useful.

This blog is going to cover software design, functional programming,
API design and more. It will focus on the Clojure programming
language, but should include other languages like JavaScript,
TypeScript, Rust, Scheme and SQL.

I have several goals for 2025, and I will be using this blog to record
my efforts in reaching these goals.

### 2025 Goals

I hope to learn or better understand the following software systems.

1. **Learn about Game Development**: Since I was a kid and playing Red Alert at my
   friend John's house I have wanted to build a Command and Conquer or
   StarCraft like game. I want to make 2025 the year when I finally
   understand game development and build something.
2. **Learn more about Immutable Linux**: Understand and better use immutable Linux
   distros. NixOS, Gnu Guix, Fedora Sliverblue are all modern
   "immutable" distributions.
3. **Deepen my understanding of Pandoc**: Pandoc is an advance
   document transformation system. It allows you to convert any
   document into any other document. It also includes a
   "transformation" system that allow you to modify documents.
4. **Deepen my understanding Rest API and GraphQL API**: Continue to
   learn and write about the best ways to design and build these type
   of API Systems.
