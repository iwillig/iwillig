Welcome to Software Ramblings, my new technical blog. I am a
professional software engineer with over 16 years of experience. I
hope this blog will encourage me to write about my experiences,
learnings and observations about software engineering. I am making
this blog public and hopefully other people will find some of this
useful.

This blog is going to cover software design, functional programming,
api design and more.
