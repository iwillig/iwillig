** Hello
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hello
:END:
I am a professional software engineer. I am currently working at
[[https://www.shortcut.com/][Shortcut]] where I have been an backend
engineer for ten years.

I primarily work in [[https://clojure.org/][Clojure]], but have
experience with Python, JavaScript, TypeScript and other languages.

I live in Brooklyn with my family. When I am not hanging out with them,
you can find me on my bike or in a hammock

Thanks for reading my [[/][blog]].
