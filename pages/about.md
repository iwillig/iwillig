title: About me
---

## Hello

I am a professional software engineer. I am currently working at
[Shortcut](https://www.shortcut.com/) where I have been an backend
engineer for ten years.

I primarily work in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), but have
experience with Python, JavaScript, TypeScript and other languages.

I live in Brooklyn with my family. When I am not hanging out with
them, you can find me on my bike or in a hammock

Thanks for reading my [blog](/).
